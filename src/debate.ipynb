However, we see generative AI enhancing the way STEM, creative, and business and legal professionals work rather than eliminating a significant number of jobs outright. Frey and Osborne (2013) estimate that 47% of total US employment is at risk of losing jobs to automation over the next decade. Their research reveals that a substantial share of employment in service occupations - where most US job growth has occurred over the past decades - are highly susceptible to computerisation. 1. AI will drive job creation Businesses responding to our survey expect artificial intelligence to be a net job creator in the coming five years. Nearly half (49%) of companies expect adopting AI to create jobs, well ahead of the 23% of respondents who expect it to displace jobs. The impact of AI on employment and the job market is a topic that sparks intense debate. I believe that it's a double-edged sword. While concerns about job replacement exist, AI creates new opportunities and reshapes job functions in ways we couldn't have imagined before.

      "Action Input: Technological unemployment\u001b[0m\u001b[38;5;200m\u001b[1;3mPage: Technological unemployment\n",
      "Summary: Technological unemployment is the loss of jobs caused by technological change. It is a key type of structural unemployment. Technological change typically includes the introduction of labour-saving \"mechanical-muscle\" machines or more efficient \"mechanical-mind\" processes (automation), and humans' role in these processes are minimized. Just as horses were gradually made obsolete as transport by the automobile and as labourer by the tractor, humans' jobs have also been affected throughout modern history. Historical examples include artisan weavers reduced to poverty after the introduction of mechanized looms. During World War II, Alan Turing's bombe machine compressed and decoded thousands of man-years worth of encrypted data in a matter of hours. A contemporary example of technological unemployment is the displacement of retail cashiers by self-service tills and cashierless stores.\n",
      "That technological change can cause short-term job losses is widely accepted. The view that it can lead to lasting increases in unemployment has long been controversial. Participants in the technological unemployment debates can be broadly divided into optimists and pessimists. Optimists agree that innovation may be disruptive to jobs in the short term, yet hold that various compensation effects ensure there is never a long-term negative impact on jobs, whereas pessimists contend that at least in some circumstances, new technologies can lead to a lasting decline in the total number of workers in employment. The phrase \"technological unemployment\" was popularised by John Maynard Keynes in the 1930s, who said it was \"only a temporary phase of maladjustment\". The issue of machines displacing human labour has been discussed since at least Aristotle's time.Prior to the 18th century, both the elite and common people would generally take the pessimistic view on technological unemployment, at least in cases where the issue arose. Due to generally low unemployment in much of pre-modern history, the topic was rarely a prominent concern. In the 18th century fears over the impact of machinery on jobs intensified with the growth of mass unemployment, especially in Great Britain which was then at the forefront of the Industrial Revolution. Yet some economic thinkers began to argue against these fears, claiming that overall innovation would not have negative effects on jobs. These arguments were formalised in the early 19th century by the classical economists. During the second half of the 19th century, it stayed apparent that technological progress was benefiting all sections of society, including the working class. Concerns over the negative impact of innovation diminished. The term \"Luddite fallacy\" was coined to describe the thinking that innovation would have lasting harmful effects on employment.\n",
      "The view that technology is unlikely to lead to long-term unemployment has been repeatedly challenged by a minority of economists. In the early 1800s these included David Ricardo himself. There were dozens of economists warning about technological unemployment during brief intensifications of the debate that spiked in the 1930s and 1960s. Especially in Europe, there were further warnings in the closing two decades of the twentieth century, as commentators noted an enduring rise in unemployment suffered by many industrialised nations since the 1970s. Yet a clear majority of both professional economists and the interested general public held the optimistic view through most of the 20th century.\n",
      "In the second decade of the 21st century, a number of studies have been released suggesting that technological unemployment may increase worldwide. Oxford Professors Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne, for example, have estimated that 47 percent of U.S. jobs are at risk of automation. However, their methodology has been challenged as lacking evidential foundation and criticised for implying that technology (rather than social policy\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mThe Wikipedia page on technological unemployment provides historical context and differing views on the impact of technology on jobs. It mentions that some studies suggest that technological unemployment may increase worldwide, with an estimate that 47 percent of U.S. jobs are at risk of automation. This information aligns with the AI alarmist perspective and can be used to support the argument that AI and automation pose a threat to employment.\n",
      "Final Answer: As an AI alarmist, I would argue that the rapid advancement of automation and artificial intelligence poses a significant threat to employment. Studies suggest that up to 47% of total US employment is at risk of being automated over the next decade, with those in lower-wage jobs being particularly vulnerable (Frey and Osborne, 2013). This is further supported by the concept of technological unemployment, which refers to the loss of jobs caused by technological change.

Nearly half (49%) of companies expect adopting AI to create jobs, well ahead of the 23% of respondents who expect it to displace jobs. Most panellists think that AI is likely to boost global growth to 4-6% per annum (relative to an average of 4% over the past few decades). Most of the panel also believes that AI is unlikely to affect employment rates in high-income countries, with the remainder split between predicting an increase and a decrease in unemployment rates. July 18, 2023 News Summary Workers Optimistic About AI and Automation's Impact on Jobs July 17, 2023 - More than 90% of American workers want AI-supported data collection in the workplace, according to a recent study commissioned by SS&C Blue Prism. The impact of AI on employment and the job market is a topic that sparks intense debate. I believe that it's a double-edged sword.

      "Action Input: Technological unemployment\u001b[0m\u001b[38;5;200m\u001b[1;3mPage: Technological unemployment\n",
      "Summary: Technological unemployment is the loss of jobs caused by technological change. It is a key type of structural unemployment. Technological change typically includes the introduction of labour-saving \"mechanical-muscle\" machines or more efficient \"mechanical-mind\" processes (automation), and humans' role in these processes are minimized. Just as horses were gradually made obsolete as transport by the automobile and as labourer by the tractor, humans' jobs have also been affected throughout modern history. Historical examples include artisan weavers reduced to poverty after the introduction of mechanized looms. During World War II, Alan Turing's bombe machine compressed and decoded thousands of man-years worth of encrypted data in a matter of hours. A contemporary example of technological unemployment is the displacement of retail cashiers by self-service tills and cashierless stores.\n",
      "That technological change can cause short-term job losses is widely accepted. The view that it can lead to lasting increases in unemployment has long been controversial. Participants in the technological unemployment debates can be broadly divided into optimists and pessimists. Optimists agree that innovation may be disruptive to jobs in the short term, yet hold that various compensation effects ensure there is never a long-term negative impact on jobs, whereas pessimists contend that at least in some circumstances, new technologies can lead to a lasting decline in the total number of workers in employment. The phrase \"technological unemployment\" was popularised by John Maynard Keynes in the 1930s, who said it was \"only a temporary phase of maladjustment\". The issue of machines displacing human labour has been discussed since at least Aristotle's time.Prior to the 18th century, both the elite and common people would generally take the pessimistic view on technological unemployment, at least in cases where the issue arose. Due to generally low unemployment in much of pre-modern history, the topic was rarely a prominent concern. In the 18th century fears over the impact of machinery on jobs intensified with the growth of mass unemployment, especially in Great Britain which was then at the forefront of the Industrial Revolution. Yet some economic thinkers began to argue against these fears, claiming that overall innovation would not have negative effects on jobs. These arguments were formalised in the early 19th century by the classical economists. During the second half of the 19th century, it stayed apparent that technological progress was benefiting all sections of society, including the working class. Concerns over the negative impact of innovation diminished. The term \"Luddite fallacy\" was coined to describe the thinking that innovation would have lasting harmful effects on employment.\n",
      "The view that technology is unlikely to lead to long-term unemployment has been repeatedly challenged by a minority of economists. In the early 1800s these included David Ricardo himself. There were dozens of economists warning about technological unemployment during brief intensifications of the debate that spiked in the 1930s and 1960s. Especially in Europe, there were further warnings in the closing two decades of the twentieth century, as commentators noted an enduring rise in unemployment suffered by many industrialised nations since the 1970s. Yet a clear majority of both professional economists and the interested general public held the optimistic view through most of the 20th century.\n",
      "In the second decade of the 21st century, a number of studies have been released suggesting that technological unemployment may increase worldwide. Oxford Professors Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne, for example, have estimated that 47 percent of U.S. jobs are at risk of automation. However, their methodology has been challenged as lacking evidential foundation and criticised for implying that technology (rather than social policy\u001b[0m\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mThe Wikipedia page on technological unemployment provides a historical perspective on the impact of technology on jobs. It confirms that technological change can cause short-term job losses and that there is a debate about whether it can lead to lasting increases in unemployment. Some economists and studies suggest that technological unemployment may increase worldwide, with an estimate that 47 percent of U.S. jobs are at risk of automation. This information supports the AI alarmist's view that automation and AI could lead to significant job losses.\n",
      "Final Answer: The impact of automation and artificial intelligence on employment is a complex issue with differing viewpoints. However, there are credible sources that support the concern about potential job losses. For instance, a DuckDuckGo search revealed that lower-wage jobs could be significantly impacted and that people in these jobs are more likely to need to transition occupations due to automation and AI. Furthermore, the concept of technological unemployment, as described on Wikipedia, shows that technological change can cause job losses and that some studies suggest a potential increase in technological unemployment worldwide. For example, Oxford Professors Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne have estimated that 47 percent of U.S. jobs are at risk of automation. Therefore, as an AI alarmist, I argue that we should be cautious about the rapid advancement of automation and AI, considering their potential to disrupt the job market and lead to significant job losses, especially among lower-wage workers.\u001b[0m\n",

According to Goldman Sachs, breakthroughs in AI could lead to the automation of a quarter of the work done in the US and eurozone [source: DuckDuckGo search]. Moreover, it is predicted that by 2030, 45 million Americans could lose their jobs to AI automation, which represents about one-quarter of the workforce [source: DuckDuckGo search]. While AI might create jobs in certain sectors, the massive waves of job losses in others cannot be ignored.

      "Final Answer: Automation and AI are undoubtedly transforming the employment landscape. However, this is not necessarily a negative development. As the study \"Small cities face greater impact from automation\" suggests, while automation may lead to worker displacement in smaller cities, it also leads to increased occupational and skill specialization in larger cities, particularly in managerial and technical professions that are not easily automatable. This suggests that automation may actually create new job opportunities in these areas. \n",
